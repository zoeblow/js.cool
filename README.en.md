- Wait for deployment

## Principe

- First of all, you need a site with content
- Check whether the subdomain is available
- Your site ~~must~~(will be nice to) have a Chinese translation edition
- Already finish web site development, or supply an opensource project you want a site for
- Illegal topics are forbbiden
- Irregular spot check to delete subdomains which have no content or not related to opensource
